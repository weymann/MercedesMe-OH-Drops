Show state of the send command sent by above channels which are able to write values.
**Don't flood the API with commands**.
The Mercedes API cannot withstand _Monkey Testing_.
Send lock/unlock or temperatures in a short period of time will result in failures.

## Vehicle Actions

You've the possibility to perform the below action in your rules. 

### Send POI

````java
    /**
     * Send Point of Interest (POI) to your vehicle.
     * This POI is shown in your vehicle messages and can be instantly used to start a navigation route to this point.
     * A "catchy" title plus latitude / longitude are mandatory.
     * Parameters args is optional. If you use it respect the following order
     * 1) City
     * 2) Street
     * 3) Postal Code
     * If you miss any of them provide an empty String
     *
     * @param title - the title will be shown in your vehicle message inbox
     * @param latitude - latitude of POI location
     * @param longitude - longitude of POI location
     * @param args - optional but respect order city, street, postal code
     */
    public void sendPoi(String title, double latitude, double longitude, String... args) 
````

### Example

If you have 2 items `Poi_Location` (PointType) and `Poi_Location_Name` (StringType).
Set first the name and then change the location and the rule will trigger.

````
rule "Send POI"
    when
        Item Poi_Location changed
    then
        val mercedesmeActions = getActions("mercedesme","mercedesme:bev:abc:xyz")
        val double lat = Poi_Location.state.getLatitude
        val double lon = Poi_Location.state.getLongitude
        mercedesmeActions.sendPoi(Poi_Location_Name.state.toString,lat,lon)
end
````

## Troubleshooting

There's a big variety of vehicles with different features and different command capabilities.
In order to be able to analyze problems 3 advanced channels are placed in the vehicle group.

* feature-capabilities - showing which feature your vehicle is eqipped with
* command-capabilities - showing which commands can be sent to your vehicle
* proto-update - latest update of your vehicle data

In case you find problems regarding this binding add items to these 3 channels.
The items are reporting Strings in json format.
Please check yourself no critical data is inside.
Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) isn't part of data.
GPS data which is showing your location is anonymized.
The content of these items shall be used to create a problem report.

Keep these 3 channels disconnected during normal operation.
